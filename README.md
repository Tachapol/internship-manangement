## Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- Email and password login with bcrypt hashing (cost factor 10)
- Dual-token auth: Access Token (JWT, 1 day) and Refresh Token (stored in database, 30 days)
- Email-based invitation flow — invited users set their own password via a secure link
- Password reset with time-limited tokens (expire after 1 hour)
- Route protection via Next.js Middleware (reads token from cookie)

### Personnel Management

- Create, edit, and delete interns, mentors, and teams
- Email invitation system with token verification
- Search and filter by company, team, and status

### Adaptive Dashboard (per role)

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Total companies, total students, attendance rate, pending leaves

- **MENTOR**: List of assigned students, daily attendance overview, pending leave requests, training plan progress
- **STUDENT**: Attendance history, personal leave status, training plan module progress, recent notifications

### Attendance

- Clock in and clock out with IP address and location recording
- Automatic status calculation: PRESENT (before 8:00 AM), LATE (after 8:00 AM), ABSENT, ON_LEAVE
- Monthly reports: present days, late days, absences, leaves, attendance rate percentage
- Mentors, BD Team, and Admins can view any student's attendance records

### Leave Requests

- Submit leave requests: Sick, Casual, Annual, Other
- Attach supporting documents (medical certificates, etc.) via Supabase Storage
- Mentors and BD Team approve or reject with optional comments
- Status flow: PENDING → APPROVED / REJECTED / CANCELLED

### Training Plans

- Create company-wide training programs (e.g., "Web Development Track")
- Split into weekly modules (Week 1, 2, 3, ...)
- Attach PDF documents or external resource links
- Track individual student progress (ACTIVE → COMPLETED)

### Notifications

- Automatically generated on significant events (leave approvals, attendance changes, training assignments)
- Categories: INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ALERT, ATTENDANCE, LEAVE, TRAINING
- Read/unread tracking, mark all as read

### Audit Logs

- Immutable record of all significant actions: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, LOGIN, LOGOUT, EXPORT, OTHER
- Stores old and new values, IP address, user agent
- Append-only — cannot be deleted or modified

### Support Tickets

- Students can submit support requests
- Staff (Admin, BD Team, Mentors) can reply, change status, and assign tickets
- Status flow: OPEN → IN_REVIEW → RESOLVED → CLOSED
- Priority levels: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9
- PostgreSQL 15+

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example file and customize:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you are connecting to an existing Supabase Cloud database (as configured in the current `.env`), you can use it directly. Otherwise, adjust the credentials.

### Initialize the Database

**Option A: Using existing Supabase Cloud Database**

```bash
# Regenerate Prisma Client from the database schema
npm run db:generate

# Seed sample data
cd packages/database
npx prisma db seed
```

**Option B: Using local PostgreSQL via Docker**

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Update .env to point to localhost
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://devplus_user:devplus_password@localhost:5433/devplus"

# Run migrations and seed
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

### Run Development Servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both services simultaneously:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:4000
- **Swagger Documentation**: http://localhost:4000/api/docs

### Run in Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start --workspace=api   # API server
npm run start --workspace=web   # Web server
```

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 10)
- JWT secret should be changed before deploying to production
- Refresh tokens are persisted in the database and can be revoked individually
- Most models use soft deletes (`deletedAt`) instead of permanent removal
- Audit logs are immutable and cannot be deleted or modified
